## What is Launchpad?
### Problem Space
FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is the ultimate sport for the mind for high school students around the world. Teams are given just six weeks each year to prototype, build, and program a robot to play a game against other robots.

Many rural or low-income teams struggle to field competitive robots due to a lack of software knowledge. FIRST disseminates its own guides for setting up software, but they fail to adequately engage and empower students with low tech literacy.

### Design Solution
**Launchpad** serves as the confident mentor in the room for teams who don't have programming leaders. It provides a structured approach to the FRC software setup process.

## Development Server
Ensure you have git, node.js, and npm installed. Then, in your computer's terminal, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Acr515/launchpad-capstone.git
cd launchpad-capstone
npm install
```

## Testing
After everything is installed, start the dev server by running:
```
npm start
```
and navigate to it in your browser at **http://localhost:5173/**.

## About
Launchpad was created by Alex Rummel for his 2025 Communication Design senior capstone project at the University of Cincinnati's College of Design. The DAAPWorks 2025 show runs from April 29th-May 3rd.
